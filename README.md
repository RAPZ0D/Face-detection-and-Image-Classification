## **This project uses machine learning techniques to perform two tasks:**.

1) Face Detection: Given an input image or video stream, the program detects faces in the image and frames them with a rectangle.
2) Image Classification: Given an input image, the program identifies what is depicted in the image by classifying it into one of several categories.
The project is written in Python and utilizes several open-source libraries, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries are commonly used in machine learning and computer vision applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
