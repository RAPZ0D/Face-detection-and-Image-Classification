# Face-detection-and-Image-Classification
Using Python programming and it's libraries such as OpenCV and Tensorflow we can create a live face detection model and also an Image Classification project

In our Project Main.py we have used Python Programming Language and created a live Face Detection which uses your Desktop/Laptop camera to detect your face

Our Second Project Begins with Image Classification using the combination of powerful python libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. 

# OPEN CV
So We have created a live face Detection program using OpenCV library which is created by INTEL and which stands for COMPUTER VISIONS. 
With the help of this library we can detect Faces, Smile, Eyes and even a Number Plate isn't that amazing!

# TENSORFLOW
Tensorflow is an open source Machine Learning library developed by GOOGLE, some of the common areas where tensorflow is used is data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, model retraining, etc.
