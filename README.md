# Face-detection-and-Image-Classification
Using Python programming and it's libraries such as OpenCV and Tensorflow we can create a live face detection model and also an Image Classification project

In our Project Main.py we have used Python Programming Language and created a live Face Detection which uses your Desktop/Laptop camera to detect your face

Our Second Project Begins with Image Classification using the combination of powerful python libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. 

# OPEN CV
So We have created a live face Detection program using OpenCV library which is created by INTEL and which stands for COMPUTER VISIONS. 
With the help of this library we can detect Faces, Smile, Eyes and even a Number Plate isn't that amazing!

OpenCV's face detection module is a popular tool for detecting faces in images and videos. It is based on the Viola-Jones algorithm, which uses a machine learning approach to detect faces in an image by analyzing their features.
The face detection module in OpenCV uses a Haar feature-based cascade classifier to detect faces. This classifier is trained on a large dataset of positive and negative samples, which helps it learn the features that are characteristic of a face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth.it a popular tool for applications such as video surveillance and facial recognition.

# TENSORFLOW
Tensorflow is an open source Machine Learning library developed by GOOGLE, some of the common areas where tensorflow is used is data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, model retraining, etc.

Tensorflow is used in various aspects such as:
1) Image and object Recognition 
2) Natural Language Processing (NLP)
3) Speech Recognition 
4) Autonomous Vehicles 
5) Healthcare
6) Gaming

In TensorFlow, you can use a neural network to train a model for image classification or other image-related tasks. The process of training a neural network involves several steps:
1) Data Preparation
2) Model Architecture Design 
3) Training the Model 
4) Hyperparameter Tuning
5) Model Evaluation
6) Model Deployement

TensorFlow provides several tools and APIs for implementing these steps, including the Keras API, which provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks. With TensorFlow, you can train models for a wide range of image-related tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
